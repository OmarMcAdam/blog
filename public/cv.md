## 🧠 Summary

Founder-minded engineer with a rare path from infrastructure and ISO 27001 consulting into product management and full-stack/mobile development. I’ve built technically ambitious products from the ground up — including a full email system and an AI health coach — and led teams through zero-to-one cycles.

I thrive on solving hard problems, turning vague ideas into working software, and shipping quickly with modern tools.
